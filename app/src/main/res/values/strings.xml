    <string name="appDescription1">In this application, you are able to check the various altitudes of which you have reached
        during your hike, the distance you have travelled from home, and the status of the battery.</string>
    <string name="appDescription2">Please note that while the Distance
        Tracker does not provide direction, it is to be used as an emergency tool in the case that you become lost and need to
        know your address/coordinates as well as the amount of kilometers you are from your designated home location.</string>
    <string name="appDescription3">We are aware that this app needs improvement. While this may only be the prototype stage,
        we hope in the future that the application can be further developed into a useful, versatile tool. Thank you for
        downloading!</string>
    <string name="infoIntro">Welcome to the Hiking portion of this application</string>
